This paper studies how collateral constraints shape firms' asset composition between real estate and non-real-estate capital. I build a dynamic two-asset model with asset-specific convex and non-convex adjustment costs, as well as asset-specific pledgeability. I estimate the model using data on Chinese listed manufacturing firms. The estimates indicate greater pledgeability of real estate but substantially higher fixed costs of adjusting it. With adjustment and financial frictions, the model matches the observed right-skewed distribution of the real-estate-to-non-real-estate ratio and the declining share of real estate in total capital as capital size increases. Removing financial frictions eliminates precautionary investments and reduces aggregate capital and revenue; removing both financial frictions and fixed costs raises aggregate capital and revenue. In both counterfactuals, aggregate TFPR increases. In a real-estate-crisis scenario in which real estate becomes non-pledgeable, investment tilts towards non-real estate due to its higher collateral value and aggregate capital rises; however, misallocation worsens: aggregate TFPR falls by 3.6% and revenue by 0.3%.
