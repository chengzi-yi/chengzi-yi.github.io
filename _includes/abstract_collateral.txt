This paper studies how collateral constraints shape firms' asset composition between real estate and non-real-estate capital. I build a dynamic two-asset model with convex and non-convex adjustment costs and asset-specific pledgeability, and I structurally estimate it using data on Chinese listed manufacturing firms. The estimates indicate substantially higher fixed costs of adjusting real estate and greater pledgeability of real estate. With these frictions, the model matches the observed right-skewed distribution of the real-estate-to-non-real-estate ratio and the declining real-estate share with firm size. Removing financial frictions eliminates collateral value and reduces aggregate capital and revenue; removing both financial frictions and fixed costs raises both. In both counterfactuals, aggregate TFPR increases. In a real-estate crisis scenario in which real estate becomes non-pledgeable, investment tilts towards non-real estate and aggregate capital rises due to the higher collateral value of non-real estate; however, misallocation worsens: aggregate TFPR falls by 3.6% and revenue by 0.3%.
