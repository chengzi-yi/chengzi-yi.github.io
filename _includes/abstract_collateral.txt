This paper studies how collateral constraints shape firms' asset composition between real estate and non-real-estate capital. I build a dynamic two-asset model with convex and non-convex adjustment costs and asset-specific pledgeability. Using data on Chinese listed manufacturing firms, I structurally estimate the adjustment-cost and pledgeability parameters. The estimates indicate substantially higher fixed costs of adjusting real estate and greater pledgeability of real estate. With these frictions, the model matches the right-skewed distribution of the real-estate to non-real-estate ratio and the declining real-estate share with firm size. Removing financial frictions eliminates collateral value and reduces aggregate capital and revenue; removing both financial frictions and fixed costs raises both. In both counterfactuals, aggregate TFPR increases. In a real-estate-crisis scenario in which real estate becomes non-pledgeable, investment tilts toward non-real-estate and aggregate capital rises due to tighter constraints and the higher collateral value of non-real-estate; however, misallocation worsens: aggregate TFPR falls by 3.6% and revenue by 0.3%.
