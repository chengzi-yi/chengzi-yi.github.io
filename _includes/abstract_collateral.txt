This paper studies how collateral constraints shape firms' asset composition between real estate and non-real-estate capital. I build and estimate a dynamic two-asset model with convex and non-convex adjustment costs and asset-specific pledgeability, using data on Chinese listed manufacturing firms. The estimates indicate greater pledgeability of real estate capital but substantially higher fixed costs of its adjustment. With adjustment and financial frictions, the model matches the observed right-skewed distribution of the real-estate-to-non-real-estate ratio and the declining share of real estate in total capital as capital size increases. Removing financial frictions eliminates precautionary investments and reduces aggregate capital and revenue; removing both financial frictions and fixed costs raises aggregate capital and revenue. In both counterfactuals, aggregate TFPR increases. In a real-estate-crisis scenario in which real estate becomes non-pledgeable, investment tilts towards non-real estate, and aggregate capital rises due to the higher collateral value of non-real estate; however, misallocation worsens: aggregate TFPR falls by 3.6% and revenue by 0.3%.
