Canonical models with heterogeneous firms and sunk export costs predict more profitable firms export ("export sorting"). This paper shows export sorting pattern varies systematically with product differentiation. Using Slovenian administrative data, I document that the gap in value added per worker between exporters and non-exporters is smaller in more differentiated sectors, particularly among multiproduct firms. I rationalise this pattern with a model in which multiproduct firms choose product scope and export participation based on cost efficiency and market-specific product appeal, featuring a "star-product" mechanism. When export costs are shared across products, high-appeal products pull marginal product lines into export bundles, diluting measured productivity among exporters. This composition effect is especially pronounced in high-differentiation sectors, where high markups allow less appealing products to be exported. When estimated separately for high- and low-differentiation sectors, the model reproduces observed sorting patterns and reveals stark policy asymmetries: a 50 percentage point tariff on one product triggers large contractions with substantial spillovers in the low-differentiation sector but minimal spillovers and little aggregate response in the high-differentiation sector.
