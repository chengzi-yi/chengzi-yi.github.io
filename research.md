### Working Papers


##### **Collateral Constraints and Asset Composition**

*Presented at BOFIT Seminar (2024/11/26), Bank of Finland; European Doctoral Programme Jamboree (2024/06/07), Barcelona; Marco Working Group (2024/04/18), European University Institute*

This paper investigates how collateral constraints influence firms’ investment allocation between real estate and non-real estate capital. I develop a model that incorporates adjustment costs and collateral constraints, where capital assets differ in both adjustment costs and pledgeability. Using data from Chinese listed firms, I estimate the model and demonstrate that financial frictions and adjustment costs play critical roles in shaping firms’ capital investment behavior. The model explains the observed high proportion of real estate in firms’ capital composition, especially for smaller firms. Introducing collateral constraints improves the model’s fit to the data. The estimation results indicate significantly higher fixed costs for adjusting real estate capital and greater pledgeability of real estate assets. Removing financial frictions leads to lower aggregate capital and revenue due to zero collateral value and reduced capital investments, whereas eliminating both frictions increases them. A real estate crise, where real estate becomes unpledgeable, can distort firms’ investment decisions and overall economic output, resulting in a 4.6% decrease in aggregate TFPR and a 0.3% reduction in aggregate revenue.

##### **Revisiting the Investment Regressions: State-owned Firms vs. Private Firms in China**

*Presented at Finance Seminar (2023/05/23), Universitat Pompeu Fabra*

The investment regression on a sample of Chinese listed firms shows that there is a significant correlation between investment rate and cash flow ratio after conditioning on average Q. This is true for both state-owned firms and private firms, which are conventionally considered to have different financial conditions. As noted by Cooper and Ejarque (2003), the violation of the constant-returns-to-scale assumption creates a wedge between average Q and marginal Q and can lead to a spurious cash effect in the investment regression even when there are no financial frictions. Following their argument, this paper examines the investment regression results of the Chinese firms by estimating a standard Hayashi's (1982) model which allows for decreasing returns to scale. The estimation results suggest that despite the decreasing returns to scale of capital, the presence of financial constraints brings the standard capital adjustment model closer to the data moments of both state-owned and private firms in China.

### Work in Progress


##### Export Dynamics of Multi-product Firms with (Non-)Differentiable Products

- Investigates how product differentiability shapes the product scope and export intensity of multi-product firms.
- Uses a structural model and detailed data from French manufacturers to explore interactions between product and export dynamics across domestic and foreign markets.
- Highlights how trade restrictions or industrial policies impact firms with varying product differentiation, linking technical efficiency and demand factors to export sorting and firm behaviour.

##### **Product Differentiability and Export Dynamics of Multi-destination Multi-product Exporter (*with Marius Gruenewald*)**

- Investigates how product differentiability affects the export decisions of multi-destination, multi-product firms.
- Utilises Colombian export data to examine distinct expansion patterns in both product and geographic dimensions for exporters of homogeneous versus differentiated goods.

##### **Decentralized Industrial Policy and Multi-Region Production Network (with *Xiaoyan Fan*)**

- Studies industrial policy in a multi-region economy interconnected by regional input-output networks, where regional governments aim to maximise local output, neglecting externalities on other regions.
- Constructs marginal intervention incentives for central and regional governments using a multi-region, multi-sector general equilibrium model.
- Evaluates industrial and fiscal policies in China. Finds that regional governments favour policies such as direct subsidies and tax reductions, with stronger effects in regions with higher fiscal capacity. In contrast, the central government implements industrial policies through the financial system, offering lower-cost credit to targeted industries and regions.
