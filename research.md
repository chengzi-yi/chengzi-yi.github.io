**Export Dynamics of Multiproduct Firms with (Non-)Differentiated Products**

Canonical models with heterogeneous firms and sunk export costs predict that more profitable firms export (“export sorting”). This paper shows that the export sorting pattern varies systematically with product differentiation. Using Slovenian administrative data, I document that the gap in value added per worker between exporters and non-exporters is smaller in more differentiated sectors, especially among multiproduct firms. I rationalise this pattern with a model in which multiproduct firms choose product scope and export participation based on their efficiency and market-specific product appeal, with firm-level sunk  costs shared across products. Estimating the model separately for high- and low-differentiation sectors reveals that the high-differentiation sector has lower demand elasticities, higher fixed production costs, lower export-entry costs, and more volatile appeal shocks; the model reproduces the observed sorting patterns. I then evaluate a 50 percentage point tariff increase on a single product and find large contractions with substantial spillovers in the low-differentiation sector but minimal spillovers and little aggregate response in the high-differentiation sector.

**Collateral Constraints and Asset Composition**

I study how collateral constraints shape firms' asset composition between real estate and non-real estate capital. I build a dynamic two-asset model featuring convex and non-convex adjustment costs and asset-specific pledgeability. Using data on Chinese listed manufacturing firms, I structurally estimate the adjustment-cost and pledgeability parameters. The estimates reveal substantially higher fixed costs for adjusting real estate and greater pledgeability of real estate assets. With these frictions, the model successfully matches the right-skewed distribution of the real-estate-to-non-real-estate ratio and the declining real-estate share as firm size increases. Removing financial frictions eliminates collateral value and reduces aggregate capital and revenue; removing both financial frictions and fixed costs increases capital and revenue. In a real-estate-crisis scenario in which real estate becomes non-pledgeable, investment tilts toward non-real-estate assets, and aggregate capital increases by 3% due to tighter constraints and the higher relative collateral value of non-real-estate capital. However, misallocation worsens: aggregate TFPR falls by 3.6% and revenue by 0.3%.

**Revisiting the Investment Regressions: State-owned Firms vs. Private Firms in China**

*Presented at Finance Seminar (2023/05/23), Universitat Pompeu Fabra*

The investment regression on a sample of Chinese listed firms shows that there is a significant correlation between investment rate and cash flow ratio after conditioning on average Q. This is true for both state-owned firms and private firms, which are conventionally considered to have different financial conditions. As noted by Cooper and Ejarque (2003), the violation of the constant-returns-to-scale assumption creates a wedge between average Q and marginal Q and can lead to a spurious cash effect in the investment regression even when there are no financial frictions. Following their argument, this paper examines the investment regression results of the Chinese firms by estimating a standard Hayashi's (1982) model which allows for decreasing returns to scale. The estimation results suggest that despite the decreasing returns to scale of capital, the presence of financial constraints brings the standard capital adjustment model closer to the data moments of both state-owned and private firms in China.
