**Collateral Constraints and Asset Composition** [Draft available upon request]
    - [Slides](https://chengzi-yi.github.io/assets/slides_collateral_investment.pdf)

<font size="2"> How do collateral constraints affect firms’ investment decisions between real estate and non-real estate capital? I use a model with non-convex adjustment costs and collateral constraints to characterize firms’ adjustments on the two capital inputs. These two capital assets differ in their adjustment costs and pledgeability. I estimate the model using the moments for a sample of Chinese listed firms and show that the model without financial frictions fails to explain the high proportion of real estate in the capital stock and the larger share of real estate in the asset composition for smaller firms. The introduction of collateral constraints brings the model closer to the data. The estimation results suggest a higher fixed cost of adjusting non-real estate capital. One unit of non-real estate assets (real estate assets) allows for external funding equivalent to 0.1115 (0.1606) units of non-real estate capital (real estate assets). The relaxation of the collateral constraints brings down the ratio between real estate and non-real estate capital by 33%.<font>

**Revisiting the Investment Regressions: State-owned Firms vs. Private Firms in China** [Draft available upon request]

<font size="2">The investment regression on a sample of Chinese listed firms shows that there is a significant correlation between investment rate and cash flow ratio after conditioning on average Q. This is true for both state-owned firms and private firms, which are conventionally considered to have different financial conditions. As noted by Cooper and Ejarque (2003), the violation of the constant-returns-to-scale assumption creates a wedge between average Q and marginal Q and can lead to a spurious cash effect in the investment regression even when there are no financial frictions. Following their argument, this paper examines the investment regression results of the Chinese firms by estimating a standard Hayashi's (1982) model which allows for decreasing returns to scale. The estimation results suggest that despite the decreasing returns to scale of capital, the presence of financial constraints brings the standard capital adjustment model closer to the data moments of both state-owned and private firms in China. <font>
