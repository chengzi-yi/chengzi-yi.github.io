##### **Collateral Constraints and Asset Composition**

This paper investigates how collateral constraints influence firms’ investment allocation between real estate and non-real estate capital. I develop a model that incorporates adjustment costs and collateral constraints, where capital assets differ in both adjustment costs and pledgeability. Using data from Chinese listed firms, I estimate the model and demonstrate that financial frictions and adjustment costs play critical roles in shaping firms’ capital investment behavior. The model explains the observed high proportion of real estate in firms’ capital composition, especially for smaller firms. Introducing collateral constraints improves the model’s fit to the data. The estimation results indicate significantly higher fixed costs for adjusting real estate capital and greater pledgeability of real estate assets. Removing financial frictions leads to lower aggregate capital and revenue due to zero collateral value and reduced capital investments, whereas eliminating both frictions increases them. A real estate crise, where real estate becomes unpledgeable, can distort firms’ investment decisions and overall economic output, resulting in a 4.6% decrease in aggregate TFPR and a 0.3% reduction in aggregate revenue.

##### **Revisiting the Investment Regressions: State-owned Firms vs. Private Firms in China** [Draft available upon request]

The investment regression on a sample of Chinese listed firms shows that there is a significant correlation between investment rate and cash flow ratio after conditioning on average Q. This is true for both state-owned firms and private firms, which are conventionally considered to have different financial conditions. As noted by Cooper and Ejarque (2003), the violation of the constant-returns-to-scale assumption creates a wedge between average Q and marginal Q and can lead to a spurious cash effect in the investment regression even when there are no financial frictions. Following their argument, this paper examines the investment regression results of the Chinese firms by estimating a standard Hayashi's (1982) model which allows for decreasing returns to scale. The estimation results suggest that despite the decreasing returns to scale of capital, the presence of financial constraints brings the standard capital adjustment model closer to the data moments of both state-owned and private firms in China.
