My advisors are [Prof. Russell Cooper](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=russell-cooper) and [Prof. Alexander Monge-Naranjo](https://www.atlantafed.org/research/economists/alexander-monge-naranjo). Additionally, I am an external research consultant for [CompNet](https://www.comp-net.org).

My research focuses on heterogeneous firms and their dynamic decisions, and spans the fields of quantitative macroeconomics, firm dynamics, finance, and trade.
